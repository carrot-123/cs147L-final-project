A self care box is a physical box that people have on hand when they feel like they need some self care. Usually, the box contains tissues, chocolates, face masks, photos, anything that can help cheer someone up. This app helps users create virtual self care boxes. Users can browse boxes they have made and filter them based on what time of day they are usually opened or whether they are “starred.” In addition, users can create new boxes which includes providing a name, a cover image, a description, a self care routine to follow, a list of items needed, some playlists to watch or listen to, and some words of affirmation. Users can also edit existing boxes. I used Supabase’s table to store boxes as well as useProvider and useReducer to keep track of the boxes' states across different screens. I also used Supabase’s buckets to store preset cover images. I used Expo Router to navigate across different screens, and React Native Paper for various UI components.
